# Password Strength Checker

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and model development for assessing password strength, utilizing machine learning techniques to classify passwords into varying strength levels.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model capable of evaluating the strength of passwords. By leveraging a dataset of labeled passwords, the project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms to accurately classify passwords based on their strength.

## Dataset
lInk for data set: [passowrdDataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkmisra/passworddataset)
The analysis utilizes the "Password Strength Classifier Dataset," which comprises a collection of passwords labeled with their respective strength categories. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the predictive models.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the distribution of password strengths and identifying patterns within the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming passwords into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Development**: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and decision trees, to classify password strength.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and refining the models to improve accuracy.

## Key Findings

- **Data Imbalance**: The dataset exhibits an imbalance in password strength categories, necessitating strategies to address this issue during model training.
- **Feature Representation**: Effective transformation of password data into numerical features significantly impacts model performance.
- **Model Performance**: The decision tree classifier demonstrated superior performance in classifying password strength compared to other models evaluated.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. **Dataset Access**: Obtain the "Password Strength Classifier Dataset" from Kaggle.
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure the necessary Python libraries are installed, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and nltk.
3. **Notebook Execution**: Run the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository to perform the analysis and model training.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the potential of machine learning in evaluating password strength, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in developing effective predictive models.
